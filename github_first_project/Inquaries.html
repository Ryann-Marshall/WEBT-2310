                 Every project undertaken by Brittle Bones Preservations‚Äîwhether it's a personalized pet memorial or an intricate art commission‚Äîis rooted in a deep, unwavering commitment to care, respect, and ethics. We treat all materials, living and preserved, with the utmost dignity, ensuring that our sourcing is responsible, our preparation is meticulous, and our artistic process honors the cycle of life. When you choose us, you are not simply commissioning a piece of art; you are entrusting us with a meaningful legacy, and we guarantee that this trust is met with a professional, compassionate, and fundamentally ethical standard from the moment your inquiry is submitted until the finished piece arrives at your door.

                 <h1>Q&A!</h1>
                
                 <h4>Where are you located?</h4>
                 <p class="abt-me">
                 Our studio is located in Williamsburg, Tennessee. While we are a small physical operation, we proudly accept and ship custom orders across the entire United States.
                 </p>
                 <hr>
                 <h4>How do you source your materials?</h4>
                 <p class="abt-me">Ethical sourcing is our highest priority. All skeletal materials are obtained through natural, non-harmful means, including from found specimens, natural decomposition, or from trusted, licensed suppliers. We never harm an animal for the purpose of our art.</p>
                    <hr>
                 <h4>What types of animals do you work with?</h4>
                 <p class="abt-me">We work with a wide variety of domestic and wild animals. Due to legal restrictions, we are unable to work with human remains, endangered species, or protected native bird species.</p>
                    <hr>
                 <h4>What is the typical turnaround time for an art piece?</h4>
                 <p class="abt-me">Turnaround time varies greatly depending on the complexity of the piece, the current cleaning/preservation queue, and the design. Custom art pieces typically require 4 to 12 weeks. </p>
                     <hr>
                 <h4>How does the memorial process work?</h4>
                 <p class="abt-me">It begins when you contact us via the Inquiry Form. We discuss your pet, the nature of the remains, your desired final design (e.g., shadow box, terrarium, articulated form), and provide a quote. Once accepted, we arrange for respectful and secure transfer of the remains to our studio for cleaning and preparation.</p>
                       <hr>
                 <h4>Can you work with remains that have already been cremated?</h4>
                 <p class="abt-me">Unfortunately, no. Our work requires the full, intact bone structure to create articulated pieces. </p>
                       <hr>
                 <h4>How do I ship my pet's remains to you?</h4>
                 <p class="abt-me">We provide detailed, clear instructions on proper packaging and shipping protocols to ensure the remains are transferred legally and respectfully. We are here to guide you through every step.</p>
                       <hr>
                 <h4>What is the cost for a memorial piece?</h4>
                 <p class="abt-me">Because every piece is custom, costs vary. Prices are based on the animal's size, the complexity of articulation, and the cost of additional artistic elements (shadow box, crystals, botanicals). Quotes typically start at $400 USD for small memorials.</p>
