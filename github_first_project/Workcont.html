                 At Brittle Bones Preservations, the memorial side of our work is handled with the utmost reverence and empathy. We understand that losing a beloved pet is incredibly difficult, and we are dedicated to transforming that loss into a tangible, beautiful tribute. Our specialized bone taxidermy offers a unique alternative to traditional memorials, allowing us to respectfully clean, prepare, and articulate your companion's skeletal remains. Each memorial piece is a custom collaboration, designed to reflect the pet's spirit—whether it is an articulated display of their full form, or an elegant arrangement of a specific bone set within an artistic tableau of crystals and botanicals. This process is deeply meaningful; it preserves the actual architecture of your cherished friend, giving you a lasting, dignified, and unique piece of art that honors their life and keeps their presence eternal.

                 This shadow box, titled "Coiled Rest," is a poignant example of how we transform a beloved pet's remains into a timeless piece of art and remembrance. Within the ornate, dark frame, the delicate, articulated skeleton of a snake is gracefully coiled and nestled onto a soft bed of moss. The bones are beautifully accentuated by soft, dried pink roses, natural foliage, and slender quartz crystals, symbolizing eternal rest and serenity. This custom piece captures the elegance of the snake's form in a respectful, peaceful arrangement, providing a deeply personal and meaningful tribute to a cherished companion.
